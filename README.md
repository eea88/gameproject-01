## Project Description
My game is a type of Wave game where the idea is to have enemies (Barbarian/Orcs) that attack your kingdom and you have to defend the kingdom with soldiers.

Enemy waves will approach the soldiers directly and your job is to manage the soldiers for them to win the battles.

Points are scored by defeating enemies. Points score will be defined in Day 3
